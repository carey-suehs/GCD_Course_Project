     *xxxxx
     
__________ASSIGNMENT & INSTRUCTIONS
    
This section simply restates the course assignment and any related instructions for clarity of purpose.

__________WORKING DIRECTORY AND LIBRARY CALLS
    
This section is where the working directory is set.  Other users will need to change this section to fit the working directory
for thier local system.

All package installation and library calls are also placed here.  Package installations are indicated as comments (preceded by "#") because the packages are already installed on my local system.  Other users may remove the "#"s as required.

__________DOWNLOAD THE DATA SET TO A LOCAL DIRECTORY

This section provides code that download the required data set to a local directory.  Other users will need to change that local directory to fit their needs.
